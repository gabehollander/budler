            This website charts historical data for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)">stock options</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            My name is Gabe Hollander, I am a developer in Boston.
            This is a project seeking to make options data more accesible on the web.
            I recently stumbled upon <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a7afPF3k-I0kjA3aybJWR1-rIQTNK_ef">this</a> drive, where a kind soul has been scraping EOD quotes for the past 2 years or so.
            Now, the data isn't perfect, but christ all mighty it's free, no login, no nothing.
            <br/><br/>
            If you're looking for the prime rib, <a href="https://www.cboe.com/">CBOE</a> runs the data racket.
            Needless to say, it is very expensive, depending on what you want.
            For example, a <a href="https://datashop.cboe.com/option-trades-subscription">subscription</a> to a daily dump of tick level options data, on all symbols, it's 6K billed annually.
            For <a href="https://datashop.cboe.com/option-trades">all</a> tick level data since 2005, on all symbols, is a <i>measly</i> 30K one time charge.
            <br/><br/>
            Right now, this website costs like 3 bucks a month to run, a couple grandmas on internet explorer could probably take it down.
            It is certainly not even in beta, it's just a website.
            I hope to scale this platform up with some juicy CBOE data in the future, so stay tuned.
